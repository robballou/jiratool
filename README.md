# JIRA Tool

A set of command line interfaces for common JIRA tasks.

A couple reasons/design intentions for this tool:

* It is configurable for the current context, so you can run similar commands in
  different folders and get results specific to those projects.
* It has options for computer-readable formats and enough useful functionality
  that can be used in a scripted setting.

## Requirements

* Python 3
* `pyyaml`
* `jira` ([pycontribs/jira](https://github.com/pycontribs/jira))
* `prettytable`

## Install

This is developed with Python 3. If your system uses Python 2, [consider using pyenv](https://github.com/yyuu/pyenv) to allow you to run both (or similar tool). Make sure you are using Python 3 when you run the first step of these install instructions.

1. Install packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
1. Add a symlink: `pushd /usr/local/bin && ln -s PATH/jiratool.py jiratool && popd`
1. Alternatively, you can add an alias: `alias jiratool="python PATH/jiratool.py"`

## Configuration

This tool currently uses basic auth for functionality. It can build on [jira-cmd](https://github.com/germanrcuriel/jira-cmd)'s configuration or you can make your own configuration.

### jira-cmd configuration

This exists as `~/.jira/config.json`. Inside of this file, it stores the username/password and JIRA URL.

```json
{
  "auth": {
    "url": "https://example.atlassian.net/",
    "user": "username",
    "token": "base64 pass"
  },
  "options": {
  }
}
```

Make sure this file is set to only be read by your user (`chmod 600 ~/.jira/config.json`)!

The authentication can either be:

* `auth.token`: this is a base64 encoded string of `username:password`.
* `auth.username` and `auth.password`: this is a plan text copy of your username and password.

### global configuration

You can also create either `~/.jira.json` or `~/.jira.yml` to configure the global connection. These should have the same `auth` structure above.

### project configuration

When you run the command, it will check the parent path for `.jira.json` or `.jira.yml`. This can be used to specify which project a directory relates to:

```yaml
project: EX1
```

## Examples

```shell
# show open issues assigned to you for the current project
$ jiratool issues.mine --open
$ jiratool --project=EX issues.mine
$ jiratool --project=EX --project=EX2 issues.mine

# show open issues assigned to jane on the current project
$ jiratool issues.all --open --assignee=jane

# open the current project's board
$ jiratool projects.board --open-url
$ jiratool projects.board -o

# assign issues to janedoe
$ jiratool issues.assign janedoe EXAMPLE-101 EXAMPLE-102

# set issue status
$ jiratool issues.status "Internal Review" EXAMPLE-101 EXAMPLE-102

# commit with the current "in progress" items in the commit message
$ git commit -am "$(jirtool --format=id.list issues.mine --in-progress): Updated things"

# open an issue
$ jiratool issues.open EXAMPLE-101
```

## Configuration Options

Some other configuration options:

### project

Key: `project`

The project to use by default for a context. Usually should be used on a project/directory level, but could be used globally.

### status_options

Key: `options.status`

A data structure defining some status settings. Currently supports `closed`, which is a list of statuses that are considered "closed" or "not open". When commands have an `--open` flag, it will use these statuses to exclude issues.

```json
"options": {
  "status": {
    "closed": ["Closed", "Done", "Resolved"]
  }
}
```

### Command options

Key: `options.CMD`

Allows you to set default flags for a command. The following example sets the `issues.mine` command to only show open commands by default.

```yaml
options:
  issues.mine:
    open: 1
```

You can turn off the default options with `--no-default-options`
